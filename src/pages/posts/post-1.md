# Ghosts

Ghosts are often depicted as spirits of the deceased that linger in the living world. These entities are believed to be remnants of souls that haven't found peace. Their presence is often associated with unfinished business or unresolved emotions. Stories of ghosts have been part of folklore across many cultures.

Many cultures view ghosts as eerie and mysterious, often appearing in haunted locations. These spectral beings are said to manifest in various forms, from transparent figures to shadowy shapes. The belief in ghosts has led to numerous legends, superstitions, and ghost-hunting practices throughout history.

Some people claim to have experienced encounters with ghosts, describing cold spots, unexplained noises, or even apparitions. These experiences fuel debates about the existence of the supernatural. While skeptics attribute these phenomena to natural causes or psychological effects, believers maintain that ghosts are real.

In popular media, ghosts are a common theme, appearing in books, movies, and television shows. These portrayals range from terrifying spirits to more benign or even humorous characters. Ghost stories continue to captivate audiences, reflecting the enduring human fascination with the unknown and the afterlife.
